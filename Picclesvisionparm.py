# Generic Usage Example:
# To run this script, use the following command in the terminal:
# python3 Photofinderparm.py [image_file_path] '[custom_text_message]'
# - [image_file_path]: Replace this with the path to your image file.
# - '[custom_text_message]': Replace this with your desired text message for the API request.
# Example:
# python3 Photofinderparm.py storephoto.jpeg 'find lemongrass in this photo'

# Required Libraries:
# Ensure the following Python libraries are installed before running this script:
# - opencv-python (for image processing, install using `pip install opencv-python`)
# - openai (for interacting with OpenAI's API, install using `pip install openai`)
# - numpy (for numerical operations, install using `pip install numpy`)
# - argparse (should be included in standard Python, used for parsing command line arguments)
# - requests (for making HTTP requests, install using `pip install requests`)

# API Key Setup:
# The script requires an OpenAI API key to interact with the OpenAI services.
# Obtain an API key from OpenAI's website (https://openai.com/).
# Once obtained, set the key in your environment variables as 'OPENAI_API_KEY'.
